# Intel Quartus Prime Development Suite:-    
Intel's proprietary software to design for Intel FPGA's, System on Chip (SoCs), Complex Programmable Gate Arrays (CPLDs) from design entry and synthesis to timing analysis,optimization, verification and simulation. Various components of Quartus Prime are:  
1) ModelSim - For simulating the design.  
2) TimeQuest timing analyser - For analysing timing violations of the design and achieving timing closures.  
3) Qsys - For system design.   
4) PowerPlay Power Analyser Tool - For analysing and achieving power requirements of the design.  
   # FPGA Design Flow:-  
1) Design Entry: Schematic Capture, HDL, Importing IP blocks, State Machine Entry, Importing EDIF files.  
2) Functional Simulation  
3) Synthesis/Mapping   
4) Place and Route  
5) Timing Analysis   
6) Simulation  
7) Programming  
8) Test and Integration  
   # Pipelined Multiplier:-   
Intel Altera's MAX 10 FPGA Development Board family was the target device.
